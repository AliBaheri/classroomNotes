### Session: Do You Hear What I Hear?: An Examination of Effective Communication 

- Erin Anika Wiley, Westat
	- Conducted a survey on presentations from statisticians. Found 5 key conclusions. 
		1. Listener engagement. 
			Do: make it understandable. Address audience you have not what you want. Why does audience need to know this info? Not give theory background. For a mixer group, aim for the middle. Show how subject fits into their big picture. Make it enjoyable. Show enthusiasm. Enjoy real life stories and humor. Pay attention. Engage audience. Check for understanding along the way. Place yourself in audiences shoes. 
			Don't: avoid text and formulas. Avoid unnecessary details. Don't go too fast. Watch for signs that audience isn't getting the message. It's not about the speaker, but about the message. 
		2. Tone of voice. 
			Conversational tone: suggests peer to peer respect. vs Instructional tone: less risk of diminishing the importance of understanding. Conversational is best for the work place. 
		3. Good practices. 
			**Who**: audience is important. **What**: all about the content especially for dealing with clients. **When**: structure time to keep audience engaged. **Where**: watch for signs of understanding. **Why**: make sure they get the info they need.  **How**: if you think about any of the above, your presentation style is already effected. People hate jargon!!!
		4. Relationships. Relationships with colleagues change over time and your communication with them will too.
		5. Thoughts about email vs communication in person. 
			- Pros: necessary and unavoidable. Can be read and referred back to. Enjoyable and pref for some. 
			- Cons: can be too reliant. (e.g. email 3 doors down). Good for specifics but not broader discussions. Tone and intent cannot be determined. 
			- Short emails are good. Bad grammar leaves negative impressions. Be responsible when using cc. 


### Keynote Lecture: Consider your Legacy 

- Cynthia Z.F. Clark
	- Gave an inspirational talk discussing what her contributions have been in her personal and professional life. She reflected and summarized what she believed her legacy is which included: (1) family (spouse, 6 children and 18 (!!) grandchildren), (2) friends and colleagues, (3) associates she has mentored, (4) leadership of research and other improvements and contributions to US official statistics (started out teaching and ended up as a leader in statistical methods for agricultural data), (5) a strategic vision that leads her to inspiring different aspects of her life, (6) honesty and integrity in her efforts. 

### Keynote Address: Know Your Power 

- Stacy Lindborg, Biogen	
	- Shared 5 reflections/tips on having a successful career which can feel like challenging at times or like a roller coaster: (1) Being busy is not the same as being productive. Failure is OK. Women underestimate their value. Men tend to overestimate value. Focus. (2) Need to learn to be dance (flexible). (3) Need to communicate. Be kind to be people; be hard on problems. (4) Need to reflect. (5) Have to be accountable to your own growth.
