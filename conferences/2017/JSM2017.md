##  My agenda 

These are the sessions I'm interested in attending. I know there a lot listed in the same time slots, but I'm hoping to catch a few talks in different ones. The numbers at the beginning list the session number.  If anyone is interested, my talk is on Tues 2-3:50pm in [Session 408 titled Methods for Single-Cell Genomic Analysis](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=214369)
