##  My agenda 

These are the sessions I'm interested in attending. I know there a lot listed in the same time slots, but I'm hoping to catch a few talks in different ones. The numbers at the beginning list the session number.  If anyone is interested, my talk is on Tues 2-3:50pm in [Session 405 titled Statistical Challenges in the Analysis of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=212483)

#### Sunday 

2-3:50pm

* 2 - Novel Statistical Methods in Imaging (Invited)
	* 2:05pm - From Statistical Visual Modeling and Computing to Communicative Learning ([Tianfu Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~tianfu.wu/), UCLA but soon NCSU)
		* "dark learning" = want to go beyond deep learning to understand the social meaning in images
		* Visual [Turning Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) in images - you can ask, answer and test story-like questions
		* Classical assumption for tracking is to use [Hidden Markov Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) and [Particle Filtering](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1280841735) (tries to integrates out previous state to predict current state). Big challenges: high-dimensional space and in-homogenous state spaces. 
	* 2:30pm - Nonparametric Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Neuroimaging Data ([Nathaniel Helwig](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~helwig/), U of Minnesota)
		* [Bilinear model](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-bilinear-models) - e.g. PCA, factor analysis, ICA. Across the rows is the temporal relationship. Across the columns is the spatial relationship. Here PCA "scores" are the temporal components and "loadings" are the spatial components. 
			* Major caveats (can rotate model without changing fit). **Rotational indeterminacy problem** = pick any orthogonal rotation matrix. we can define a new rotation. To solve in practice, people assume this bilinear model form and assume the columns (or rows) are independent. Tensor
		* Models for three-way data. Argues these are under utlized models (i.e. multi-mode, multi-linear)
			* The Covariation Chart by Raymond Cattell (1952) - first illustration of a three-way array
			* Tucker's three-way factor analysis model (1966) - assumes a cube of data is composed of a smaller cube
			* Parafac (parallel factors) - popular in chemistry. No rotational indeterminacy problem (yay!)
		* Tensor models with smoothness constraints. Can analyze variation across time, space and samples. Suggests using the parafac model, but uses a smoothed component function across the ith time point and jth spatial point. 
			* e.g. B-splines basis, smooth splines, second-order difference penalty. (All adds big computational costs due as does sample size)
		* [bigsplines R pkg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigsplines/index.html) = Smoothing Splines for Large Samples
	* 2:55pm - Bayesian Feature Screening for Big Neuroimaging Data via Massively Parallel Computing ([Jian Kang](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jiankang/), U of Michigan)
		* **structural imaging** (measures brain structures or shows contrasts between brain tissues e.g. MRI) vs **functional imaging** (measures neural activity and makes inference on the brain function)
		* Data: [Autism brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4162310/) - Goal is to develop a biomarker using neuro-imaging data to predict risk of disease. Biomarker used is the Voxel-wise fALFF value (captures local brain activity). Total of 1112 individuals (~500 cases, ~500 controls). Data from individual captured includes 175K voxels in 116 ROIs (regions of interest). 
		* Models: "Scalar-on-Image Regression". Discussed many variable selection methods and "ultra-high dimensional [variable screening](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/bloomfield/courses/st430-514/slides/MandS-ch06-sec01-04.pdf)" methods. Author extends models to a bayesian framework for the Posterior Mean Screening.
